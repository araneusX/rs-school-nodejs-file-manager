# File Manager

We are excited to share our software with you and hope you enjoy using it. As this is the first version, there may be some features that are not fully optimized yet.

Please follow these guidelines when using the application. They are consistent with the technical specifications and provide some additional clarity.

1. Spaces in file names and paths are not allowed.

2. If you receive file access permission errors, execute the script with administrator privileges.

3. When entering parameters for the `compress` and `decompress` functions, specify paths, including the file name and extension, for both the input and output files.

Donâ€™t worry, we are working hard to enhance and refine our software in the upcoming versions. We appreciate your feedback and support as we strive to deliver the best product experience for you. ðŸ˜Š
