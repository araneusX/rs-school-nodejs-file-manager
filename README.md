We are excited to share our software with you and hope you enjoy using it. As this is the first version, there may be some features that are not fully optimized yet.

Please follow these guidelines when using the application. They are consistent with the technical specifications but provide some additional clarity.

1. Use _**DOUBLE**_ quotes if you want to specify a path or filename with _**spaces**_. `rn "Hello World.txt" hello.md`

2. _**Double quotes**_ inside file names and paths are _**not**_ allowed. 

3. If you receive file access _**permission errors**_, execute the script with _**administrator/root**_ privileges.
- Don't forget to check that the _**administrator/root**_ user has the correct _**version**_ of _**Node.js**_ installed.

4. When entering parameters for the `compress` and `decompress` functions, specify paths, _**including**_ the _**file**_ name and _**extension**_, for both the input and _**output**_ files.

Donâ€™t worry, we are working hard to enhance and refine our software in the upcoming versions. We appreciate your feedback and support as we strive to deliver the best product experience for you. ðŸ˜Š
