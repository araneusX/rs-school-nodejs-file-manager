File Manager

We are excited to share our software with you and hope you enjoy using it. As this is the first version, there may be some features that are not fully optimized yet.

1. Spaces in file names and paths are not allowed.

2. If you are using a command that requires a source file and a destination, your destination must contain the output file name with the extension.

3. If you receive file access permission errors, execute the script with administrator privileges.

Donâ€™t worry, we are working hard to enhance and refine our software in the upcoming versions. We appreciate your feedback and support as we strive to deliver the best product experience for you. ðŸ˜Š
